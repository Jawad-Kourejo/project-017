        <h4>What We Believe</h4>
        <p>
          We strongly believe in the importance of integrating socially
          beneficial programs and practices into our business model and culture
          as a part of paying back to the local society, as well as attracting
          positive attention to certain issues and causes. To that end, we are
          proud to be involved with over 20 initiatives every year and we ensure
          that all Imdaad departments have CSR activity participation as one of
          their KPIs.
        </p>

        <span>Our CSR strategy has been to focus on 4 key areas:</span>
        <span>Environmental Sustainability</span>

        <p>
          Environmentally sustainable and responsible behaviour is one of
          Imdaad’s core values. This is woven into our business practices and
          supplemented by our Envirocare Month initiative, a drive towards
          motivating people to recycle materials that would otherwise end up in
          landfills. Morever, we are also delighted to participate in events
          such as DEWA’s Earth Hour. <br />
          <br />
          DEWA’s successful Earth Hour initiative is one that Imdaad has
          embraced. We are participating in a walkathon to raise awareness, and
          are delighted to have brought some of our clients onboard as well.
          <br />
          <br />
          We also run a series of sustainability workshops that focus on the
          communities within which we deliver our services. These have excellent
          results and are proven to increase participation in important
          activities such as recycling. Similarly, campaigns such as Clean up
          the World and targeted campaigns focused on cleaning up our beaches
          have also had successful outcomes.
        </p>

        <span>Taking Care of Our Community</span>

        <p>
          This is an area that we have chosen to focus on due to the importance
          of human capital within our company. We take our obligations as a
          responsible employer of over 6,000 people extremely seriously and we
          empower our staff to help those less fortunate. <br />
          <br />
          Imdaad works closely with Red Crescent, giving employees an easy
          opportunity to donate clothes, personal effects and other items. We
          have activated this relationship through events and internal
          promotions.
          <br />
          <br />
          Moreover, every Ramadan we sponsor a service that provides boxes of
          food staples to those in need.
        </p>

        <span>Be’ati</span>

        <p>
          Imdaad’s commitment to environmental education is exemplified by our
          flagship CSR initiative Be’ati and its mascot, Khadour. Be’ati is an
          environmental program that we run at schools in conjunction with the
          KDHA, aimed at raising awareness about waste, waste-management,
          sustainability and recycling. It is combined with exploring how we can
          best preserve our planet, protect the environment and considering how
          all these initiatives positively impact the quality of life in the
          present and future. <br />
          <br />
          Khadour himself has become a minor celebrity with many requests for
          him to return to the many schools he has visited!
        </p>

        <span>Giving Our Time</span>

        <p>
          Wherever possible, we offer our employees an opportunity to contribute
          to worthy causes by providing free services. We have found that this
          hands on approach is popular with our people as it allows them to see
          the fruits of their labour and interact with the people that it
          benefits.
          <br />
          <br />
          Examples of these events are our visits to Rashid Centre for the
          Determined Ones and the FM and Environmental Services that we provide
          for Dubai Autism Centre, UAE Downs Syndrome Association and Cancer
          Centres.
        </p>

        <div class="CSR-page-container-grid"></div>
        <span>Beati Program (Schools)</span>
        <p>
          Be’ati is an environmental education program, in collaboration with
          KHDA, designed for school children, and aimed at increasing awareness
          about waste, waste-management, sustainability and recycling, combined
          with efforts to preserve our planet, protect the environment and how
          all these initiatives positively impact the quality of life in present
          and future.
